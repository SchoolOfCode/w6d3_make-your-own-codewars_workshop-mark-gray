/* 

AHOY THERE! WELCOME ABOARD;

WE WANT TO TAKE ON SUPPLIES!
Your function takes in an array of SUPPLIES.

THE BOAT CAN ONLY HANDLE A CERTAIN WEIGHT LIMIT!
The amount of SUPPLIES * 10.

YOUR SUPPLIES!
Will be an array between index 0-9 and each supply will have a value between 1-99. The value of the item will never exceed the WEIGHT LIMIT and the value will always ASCEND.

EXAMPLE!
Your SUPPLIES = [1, 5, 14, 43, 75, 90] would mean the boat has a WEIGHT LIMIT of 60 (6 SUPPLIES * 10).

Returning - [1, 5, 43] would be correct, as this is the most amount of SUPPLIES without exceeding WEIGHT LIMIT.

*/

export default function sailedTheSeas(supplies){
    
    // return an array of supplies
    // up to the weight limit

}
