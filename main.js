/* 

AHOY THERE! WELCOME ABOARD;

WE WANT TO TAKE ON SUPPLIES!
Your function takes in an array of 'supplies'.

THE BOAT CAN ONLY HANDLE A CERTAIN WEIGHT!
The amount of items * 10.

YOUR SUPPLIES!
Will be an array between index 0-9 and filled with random numbers 1-99.

Returned 'supplies' should be sorted from lowest to highest value.

EXAMPLE!
Your supplies = [1, 5, 75, 43, 14, 90] would mean the boat can take weight of 60 (6 items * 10).

Returning - [1, 14, 43] would be correct, as this is the most amount of items without exceeding weight limit.

*/

let array = [1, 5, 75, 43, 14, 90]

export default function sailedTheSeas(array){
    
    // your code here

}
